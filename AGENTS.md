# AGENTS.md

## Rules

* **Never** run `git push`.
* Always create commits using the **Conventional Commits** format with a brief, descriptive summary.
* Update the **`[Unreleased]`** section of `CHANGELOG.md` before creating a commit.
* Write appropriate tests for every change:

  * Add unit tests where applicable.
  * Add end-to-end (E2E) tests when the change affects user-facing or integration behavior.
  * Cover relevant edge cases and error scenarios.
* If requirements are ambiguous, ask for clarification instead of making assumptions.
